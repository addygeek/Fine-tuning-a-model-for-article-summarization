# Fine-tuning a Model for Article Summarization

## Overview
This project demonstrates the fine-tuning of a pre-trained language model for automatic article summarization using supervised fine-tuning (SFT). The implementation leverages state-of-the-art transformer models to generate concise and coherent summaries of articles while maintaining key information and context.

## Dataset
The project uses a curated dataset for training and evaluation:
- **Training Data**: `sft_train_samples.jsonl` - Training samples in JSONL format
- **Validation Data**: `sft_val_samples.jsonl` - Validation samples for model tuning
- **Test Data**: `sft_test_samples.csv` - Test samples for final evaluation

Each sample contains:
- Original article text
- Human-written reference summary
- Metadata for evaluation purposes

## Requirements
Install the required dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Key Dependencies
- PyTorch
- Transformers (Hugging Face)
- Datasets
- CUDA (for GPU acceleration)
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization)

## Usage
### Training the Model
1. **Data Preparation**: Ensure your dataset files are in the correct format and location
2. **Model Configuration**: Adjust hyperparameters in the training script
3. **Training**: Run the fine-tuning process
